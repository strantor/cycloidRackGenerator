Change the variables at the start of cycloidRack.py and then run cycloidRack.py.
The DXF file will called test3.dxf and it will be overwritten each time you run the script,
so either change the name of the output file near the end of the script or make copies of anything you wish to keep.

NOTE:
The script does not use any units, so the units of the DXF file are unpredictable.
If you enter units of mm, the DXF file will be scaled too large by a factor of 1000.
